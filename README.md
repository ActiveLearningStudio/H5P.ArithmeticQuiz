H5P Arithmetic Quiz
=========================

Arithmetic quiz containing addition, division, multiplication and subtraction of numbers where the answer is between 0 and 100.

Enabling the equations mode, based on the selected arithmetic type, different types of equation will be generated.
You can also configure the difficulty (basic, intermediate or advanced) of the equations.
It rely on algebra.js by nicolewhite to build, display, and solve algebraic equations.

Sample equations:

  Basic equations:
    Addition: [ x + 17 = 12 ]
    Subtraction: [ y - 6 = 13 ]
    Multiplication: [ 8y = 5 ]
    Division: [ 7/3y = 22 ]
  Intermediate equations:
    Addition: [ 11x + 111 = 9 ]
    Subtraction: [ 6y - 110 = 17 ]
    Multiplication: [ 72y + 11 = 15 ]
    Division: [ 88/5y + 3 = 13 ]
  Advanced equations:
    Addition: [ 6x + 57 = 5x + 51 ]
    Subtraction: [ 8y - 74 = 6y - 23 ]
    Multiplication: [ 14y - 8 = 6y + 4 ]
    Division: [ 32/11y + 6 = 5y - 7 ]
